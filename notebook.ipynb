    "story_text = \"\"\"Once upon a time, in a land where the skies were painted with hues of gold and lavender, there existed a kingdom called Liora. Liora was a place of enchantment, where rivers sang lullabies, forests whispered ancient secrets, and the stars danced in patterns that told stories of old. The kingdom was ruled by a wise and kind queen named Seraphina, who was beloved by her people for her compassion and unwavering sense of justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queen Seraphina had a daughter, Princess Amara, who was as radiant as the morning sun. Amara possessed a curious mind and a heart full of dreams. She spent her days exploring the vast libraries of the palace, reading tales of distant lands and forgotten heroes. But what she loved most was venturing into the Whispering Woods, a mystical forest that bordered the kingdom. The woods were said to be alive, their ancient trees guarding secrets and treasures beyond imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "One day, as Amara wandered deeper into the forest than she ever had before, she stumbled upon a hidden glade. In the center of the glade stood a magnificent tree, its bark shimmering like silver and its leaves glowing with a soft, golden light. Beneath the tree sat an old woman with eyes that sparkled like the night sky. She introduced herself as Elara, the Keeper of the Whispering Woods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elara told Amara that the tree was the Heart of Liora, the source of the kingdom's magic and prosperity. But she also revealed a grave secret: the Heart was dying. A dark force, born of envy and greed, had begun to seep into the land, poisoning the tree and weakening its magic. If the Heart were to perish, Liora would fall into darkness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amara, determined to save her kingdom, vowed to find a way to heal the Heart. Elara gave her a small, crystal vial filled with starlight and told her that the key to saving the Heart lay in the three Trials of Virtue. These trials would test her courage, compassion, and wisdom. Only by completing them could she restore the Heart and protect Liora.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first trial led Amara to the Caverns of Echoes, a labyrinth of tunnels where every sound was amplified a thousandfold. The caverns were guarded by a fearsome creature known as the Shadow Wraith, a being made of darkness and fear. To pass the trial, Amara had to face her deepest fears and silence the wraith with the power of her courage.\n",
    "\n",
    "As she ventured deeper into the caverns, the whispers of her doubts and fears grew louder. But Amara remembered the stories of bravery she had read and the lessons her mother had taught her. She stood tall, her heart steady, and spoke words of hope and strength. The Shadow Wraith, unable to withstand the light of her courage, dissipated into nothingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second trial brought Amara to the Valley of Tears, a desolate land where the rivers ran dry and the earth was cracked and barren. Here, she encountered a group of lost souls, spirits who had been forgotten by the world. They wept for the love and kindness they had never known. To pass the trial, Amara had to show them compassion and help them find peace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amara knelt beside the spirits and listened to their stories. She shared her own hopes and dreams, and in doing so, she reminded them of the beauty of life. With tears in her eyes, she poured the starlight from Elara's vial into the dry riverbed. The land began to heal, and the spirits, filled with gratitude, ascended to the heavens, their sorrows finally at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final trial took Amara to the Summit of Wisdom, a towering peak that reached into the clouds. At the summit, she met the Guardian of Knowledge, a majestic eagle with feathers of pure gold. The guardian posed a riddle: \"What is the greatest power in the world?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Amara thought deeply. She considered the strength of armies, the brilliance of the mind, and the force of nature. But then she remembered the lessons of her journey. \"The greatest power,\" she answered, \"is love. Love gives us courage, inspires compassion, and guides us to wisdom.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The eagle nodded, its golden eyes gleaming with approval. It spread its wings and soared into the sky, leaving behind a single feather. Amara took the feather and returned to the Heart of Liora.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the feather, the starlight, and the lessons she had learned, Amara performed a ritual to heal the Heart. The tree's leaves began to glow brighter, its roots reaching deeper into the earth. The dark force that had threatened the kingdom was banished, and Liora was filled with light and life once more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queen Seraphina and the people of Liora celebrated Amara's triumph, and the kingdom flourished like never before. Amara, now a hero in her own right, continued to explore the Whispering Woods, always seeking new adventures and stories to tell.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, the tale of Princess Amara and the Heart of Liora became a legend, a story of courage, compassion, and wisdom that would be told for generations to come. In the land where the skies were painted with hues of gold and lavender, the magic of love and the power of a brave heart would always prevail.\n",
